<p>Clan Labs' features are pretty neat; however, I don't like how they charge people for stuff that isn't too hard to re-create.  There are other clients that can do the same things as Clan Labs for absoultely free, but you can't see their source code--which sucks.<br><b>So here I am, recreating Clan Labs!:)</b></p>
